# Excel-Project-RealMadrid
Data set for Real Madrid And The captain Ramos From 2005 to 2021 for all matches in every season 


I am happy to share with you my first complete project in data analysis ðŸ“Š
Of course, this is the first project that I did on my own without explanation or guidance, and I tried to rely on it to apply everything I learned theoretically and also develop the skill of searching for solutions. I first started by defining the field and chose a field that I love to give me motivation to continue the project and encourage myself because of my understanding of the field.






1- I chose the data from Kaggle, which was a data set for the Real Madrid team and written by Sergio Ramos.






2- I took the data and downloaded it to Excel and started cleaning and arranging it because the data was very chaotic. I share with you the pictures before and after cleaning and arranging.


Of course, cleaning took time and effort because the first time I received data that was not ready to be displayed, I was also searching on Google to find the missing data and also editing the wrong data, so I had to be careful to clean it appropriately, but you can imagine that there was nothing but it was missing and everything in the data was lost ðŸ˜‚

But I continued and motivated myself and felt a sense of accomplishment every time I applied what I learned, thank God




3- After I cleaned it, now it is my turn to explore the data and see the data I need and get rid of what I donâ€™t need. I merged some columns and also created some columns in order to shorten the work for myself and also to extract more and broader information.




4- I looked at some of the existing data and discovered the most important things that I need to focus on and build the dashboard on




5- The best stage is that I entered Power Bi and started to adjust the dashboard, and from scratching, I suddenly became color blind and did not know how to arrange colors and shapes ðŸ˜‚ but I entered YouTube and learned something very important that made a difference with me, which is how to represent statistical data, which helped me greatly. I know how to represent all the data according to the following form. It suits it, how the colors are graded, and how can I apply it correctly and is comfortable for the viewer, especially because the descriptive data was more than the quantitative data, so I also had to use the DAX language, and frankly, it made a huge difference with me, and it gave me results while I was working on Excel, and I also had to enter power query every now and then to modify some types of data. And arrange it again




Praise be to God, I finished this project completely and learned many things, had it not been for God, then applying and experimenting with it myself I would not have known, and I reached the point of making this wonderful interactive dashboard.

 I uploaded the work to the Power Bi platform so that you can interact with the dashboard. Also, if you need the data, I uploaded the entire work here.
